Excellent ‚Äî that paper (Okie & Brown 2009) organizes its results around several classic island biogeography patterns, each connected to body size and species richness. Let‚Äôs go through them one by one, in summary form:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Diversity‚ÄìArea Relationship

What it means: Larger islands host more species (classic species‚Äìarea relationship).

Findings:

Species richness and genus richness both increase with island area.

The relationship follows a power law (
ùëÜ
=
ùëê
ùê¥
ùëß
S=cA
z
), with 
ùëß
‚âà
0.23
z‚âà0.23 for species, 
ùëß
‚âà
0.19
z‚âà0.19 for genera.

This explains a large portion of variation (R¬≤ > 0.9).

Take-home: Island area is a strong driver of mammal diversity.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Nested Subsets

What it means: Small island communities are subsets of larger island communities (species aren‚Äôt randomly distributed; larger islands contain nearly all the species from smaller islands).

Findings:

Species distributions show a nested pattern.

Rare species (few islands) tend to be either very small or very large in body size.

Widespread species (on many islands) are mainly of intermediate body size (100 g ‚Äì 1 kg).

Take-home: Community structure is nested and strongly filtered by body size.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Body Size Distributions

What it means: Look at the overall distribution of body sizes across islands.

Findings:

Large islands: broader range of body sizes (include very small + very large species).

Small islands: narrower range, often dominated by intermediate body sizes.

Take-home: Island size limits which body sizes can persist ‚Äî extremes are pruned on small islands.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Size‚ÄìIncidence Relationship

What it means: Relationship between body size and how widespread a species is (how many islands it occurs on).

Findings:

Intermediate-sized species (100 g ‚Äì 1 kg) occur on the greatest number of islands.

Very large or very small species occur on few islands (restricted, vulnerable).

Take-home: Persistence and colonization ability peak at intermediate body sizes.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Size‚ÄìArea Relationship

What it means: How average body size of island faunas changes with island area.

Findings:

Larger islands support a wider range of body sizes, including both very large and very small mammals.

Smaller islands tend to filter out body-size extremes, leaving mostly medium-sized species.

Take-home: Island area doesn‚Äôt just affect richness, but also shapes trait distributions (here, body size) of the community.

üéØ Overall Summary

Area ‚Üí Diversity: Bigger islands = more species (classic SAR).

Nestedness: Smaller islands = subsets of larger ones, not random.

Body size filtering: Both richness and incidence patterns show that extremes in body size are disadvantaged; medium-sized species dominate across islands.

Integration: The results connect island biogeography theory (area‚Äìrichness) with functional ecology (body size as a filter for persistence and colonization).
